    Blueberries, raspberries, and strawberries are all high in vitamin C, which helps cope with stress. It helps clear out cortisol a hormone that is released during stressful periods.

        </big>
  <p>Everyone loves a bit of chocolate. And if you don’t then you’re just a bit weird. The very taste of chocolate can produce a near euphoric state in many people. Dark chocolate is full of protein and fibre and supports a positive mood and healthy cognition.

  <br>
  Does that mean dark chocolate makes people smarter?

    Mackerel, salmon, sardines, and trout all have high amounts of omega-3 fatty acids, which can alleviate anxiety.

  <p>
    Many herbal teas, such as chamomile, have calming properties. Black, green, white and red (rooibos) teas are also rich in antioxidants. Drinking a cup of warm tea can relieve stress and lift the spirits.

  Everyone feels better after a cuppa! A herbal cuppa!

    Apples, bananas, and oranges are packed with fiber and vitamin C. The sweet tastes and aromatic smells of these fruits can brighten one’s outlook and promote well-being.

  <big>1.	Caffeine
  </big>
  <p>
   Caffeine can trigger the body's fight-or-flight response. Very similar to the symptoms associated with anxiety, caffeine can also make its users feel nervous, nauseous, light headed, jittery and yes, even anxious.

  <br>
  If you have anxiety, I recommend reconsidering that morning cup of coffee and instead opt for an herbal tea or a smoothie with some leafy greens!

  <big>1.	Alcohol
  </big>
  <p>
    Alcohol in excess or at all (for some), is said to induce the symptoms of anxiety. Alcohol is a toxin that leads to improper mental and physical functioning, by negatively impacting the levels of serotonin (the feel good chemical) in the brain
  <br>
  Think before you drink!

  <big>2.	Gluten
  </big>
  <p>
    Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley and rye products. Gluten can also be a huge trigger for anxiety symptoms. Cutting out gluten could be the difference between living with anxiety and managing it for the better

  <br>
  Gluten can be associated with carbs and generally brown carbs have been seen to be better than white carbs.

    3. Sugars

  </big>
  <p>
    Sugars- artificial and refined can create changes in your body that can exacerbate anxiety symptoms and impairs the body's ability to effectively cope with stress.
  <br>
  A sugar crash is similar to a caffeine crash, and can also cause mood changes, heart palpitations, difficulty concentrating and fatigue— all of which can be interpreted as the beginning stages of an anxiety or panic attack.
