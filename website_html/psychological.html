Therapy & Medical Advice
    </h2>
    <p>
      Seeking therapy is an excellent way of taking care of your emotions. It helps you to build a coping mechanism for when challenging times come around. By talking to a professional you can break your emotions into parts, find out the reason behind your emotional distresses and ways to move forward.
<br>
Everyone is different, and for that reason everyone requires a different approach, if you feel like therapy is not enough for you talk to your  GP for further advice.
